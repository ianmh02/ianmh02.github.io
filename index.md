## Introduction

Hello, my name is Ian Harris and I will be a freshman this fall at The Ohio State University. I am an Aeronautical and Astronautcial Engineering, Astrophysics and Astronomy, and Physics Major, and Math Minor. Over the past year, I have started my adventure into the life of coding. Through my Astronomy degree I have started to learn the language of Python, and through my Engineering degree I have learned the language of MATLAB. And now, I am thrilled to be learning Swift.

Over the past summer, I have been taking The Ohio State University's Digital Flagship Coding Class that teaches OSU students an alumni how to code apps for IOS devices. After only a week and a half I have learned about Swift Playgrounds, constants vs variables, data types, operators, control flow, Xcode, functions, structures / classes, collections, optionals, and much more! With each coming day I work further in the course, the more fluent and skilled I become in the language of Swift.
